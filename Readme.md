# Azure DevOps & GitHub Integration - Testing Repository

## Project Overview

This repository serves as a **test project** for learning and experimenting with the integration between **Azure DevOps** and **GitHub**. The primary objective of this repository is to:
- Understand how Azure DevOps and GitHub work together in the software development lifecycle.
- Test continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) pipelines with Azure DevOps using a GitHub repository.
- Practice handling code versioning, commits, and collaboration using both GitHub and Azure DevOps tools.

## Purpose of This Repository

- **Testing Azure DevOps Pipelines**: Set up and test CI/CD pipelines with this repository.
- **Learning GitHub Integration**: Experiment with how GitHub and Azure DevOps communicate, such as pushing code to both platforms, setting up service connections, and automating workflows.
- **Version Control Practice**: Learn how to use Git to manage code changes across two different platforms.

## Steps to Set Up Integration

### 1. Clone the Repository
To start working on this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Setting Up Azure DevOps Pipeline
Follow these steps to set up the Azure DevOps pipeline for this GitHub repository:

- **Create a new Azure Pipeline**:
  1. In Azure DevOps, go to your project.
  2. Under **Pipelines**, select **Create Pipeline**.
  3. Select **GitHub** as the source and authorize the connection to your GitHub account.
  4. Follow the steps to select your repository and configure your pipeline with a starter YAML file (or create a new one in the `.azure-pipelines/` directory of this repo).

- **Example Pipeline YAML** (placed in `.azure-pipelines/ci-pipeline.yml`):

```yaml
# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:
- script: echo Hello, world!
  displayName: 'Run a one-line script'

- script: |
    echo Add other tasks to build, test, and deploy your project.
    echo See https://aka.ms/yaml
  displayName: 'Run a multi-line script'

```

### 3. Pushing Code Changes

To push changes to both GitHub and Azure DevOps, follow these steps:

1. **Make code changes** in your local repository.
2. **Commit** those changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial test commit for integration"
   ```

3. **Push** changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push github main
   ```

4. Azure DevOps pipelines will be triggered based on the push event.

### 4. Running the Pipeline

- After committing and pushing changes to GitHub, check your **Azure DevOps Pipeline**.
- The pipeline should automatically start running based on your commit to GitHub.
- If set up properly, you'll see the results of the build and any deployed artifacts in Azure DevOps.

## Key Learnings and Experiments

- **Azure DevOps Pipeline Creation**: Understand how to create and manage pipelines for CI/CD.
- **GitHub and Azure DevOps Integration**: Test how code pushed to GitHub triggers Azure DevOps pipelines.
- **Workflows Automation**: Set up workflows to automate tasks, such as building, testing, and deploying the code.

---

## Future Plans

- **Expand Pipelines**: Experiment with more complex pipeline configurations such as adding testing, deployment, and rollback steps.
- **Multi-branch Strategy**: Learn how to manage multiple branches in GitHub and Azure DevOps with branching strategies like GitFlow.
- **Secrets Management**: Explore how to manage secrets and environment variables between GitHub and Azure DevOps.
- **Collaborative Workflows**: Set up integration with Azure DevOps Boards for managing work items based on GitHub activity.
